This contains most of the initial plots to check what the data contains,
oscillations probability...

Also plots of the NLL wrt to theta, mass difference, alpha, and sigma, used to see how it behaved.

The impact of the detector resolution (Gaussian width) on the convolved spectrum is plotted there as well.

The contour plot of NLL depending on 2D is included.


2) Minimisers.py
In this file there are all the functions that were used for the calculations throughout the tasks.
This includes minimiser for all dimensions, error estimation functions, and validation functions.


3) Validate.py
This file there are printed results for testing the minimisers with different functions in several dimensions. Some didn't work very
well but with the time at hand I used then and estabished the accuracy with other methods


4) results.py
Here there are printed results for the parameters extraction and calculations for each task that
I talk about in the report
IMPORTANT: the 4D minimiser results take a lot of time, if you want to comment them out feel free.
